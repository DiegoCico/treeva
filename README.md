- **Interactive Dark/Light Modes**: Customize the appearance of the app with a toggle between dark and light modes, ensuring a comfortable user experience.
- **User Profile and Progress Tracking**: Displays user information, team members, and an animated progress circle based on closed tickets, helping users track their individual contributions.
- **Team Collaboration and Analytics**: Track progress per sprint with a breakdown of tickets assigned to each team member. Detailed statistics and charts help teams understand performance over time.
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time data storage and retrieval using Firebase Firestore for managing users, tasks, and sprints. All data is securely stored and accessible across devices.
- **Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Design**: Adaptable for both desktop and mobile environments, ensuring that team members can stay updated on the go.
- **Task Management with Ticket System**: Add, edit, and delete tasks within sprints. Each task includes tickets that can be assigned, reassigned, and marked as completed.
- **Dynamic Task Categories and Difficulties**: Supports categorizing tasks and assigning difficulty levels, allowing teams to prioritize work effectively.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Includes animated elements, smooth transitions, and tooltips for an improved user experience, making project management both functional and visually appealing.

## Project Structure

- **`Homepage`**: The main entry point, rendering the side navigation, user profile, and 3D visualizations.
- **`IslandScene`**: Renders the 3D scene with trees using @react-three/fiber, representing each sprintâ€™s progress as stages of a tree. By selecting the tree you can view analytics of the sprint.
- **`Task Management`**: Add, edit, and delete tasks within sprints. Each task column is styled to be responsive and intuitive, providing quick access to task details.
- **`Analytics`**: Visualizes sprint progress with charts, tracking open and closed tickets over time. This helps teams quickly identify trends and areas for improvement.

## Getting Started

1. **Tree Visualization**: Click on a tree to focus on its progress in the sprint. Hover over trees to see sprint names, representing the tasks completed in that sprint.
2. **Add New Task**: Click the "Add Task" button in each sprint column to quickly create and assign new tasks.
3. **Switch Themes**: Toggle between light and dark modes using the button in the sidebar to suit your preference.
4. **Track Analytics**: View detailed ticket stats for each sprint, including team member progress, tickets closed, and completion percentage.

## Code Overview

### Key Components

1. **`Homepage`**:
   - Manages active views, allowing users to switch between the User Profile, Sprints, and 3D Visualization.
   - Retrieves and displays user and workspace data from Firebase Firestore.

2. **`IslandScene`**:
   - Renders the 3D tree visualization for sprints, with animations and camera movement based on user interactions.
   - Each tree stage is represented by a unique GLTF model, allowing for visually distinct stages of progress.

3. **`Analytics`**:
   - Uses Victory charts to render ticket stats, providing insights into sprint progress and individual contributions.
   - Displays member stats with ticket assignments and closures, giving teams a clear view of each member's productivity.

4. **`UserProfile`**:
   - Shows detailed user information, lists team members, and displays a progress circle with color-coded indicators for completion percentage.

### Styles and Themes

The CSS files include styles for both dark and light modes, integrated into the `Homepage` component. Color variables are defined to keep a consistent look across the app, ensuring a seamless experience when switching themes.

### Firebase Structure

- **Users**: Stores user profile information, including personal details and contact information.
- **Workspaces**: Contains workspace-level data, including sprints, tasks, and team members. Holds task data, each containing a series of tickets for more granular tracking.

### Customization

- **3D Models**: Replace tree models in the `public/` directory to change the appearance of each sprint stage.
- **Styling**: Modify CSS variables in `Task.css` to customize colors, layouts, and animations.
- **Firebase Data Structure**: Extend the current Firebase structure to include additional fields, such as task comments, attachments, or custom statuses.

## Dependencies

- **Victory**: Charting library for rendering analytics, making it easy to track sprint progress and visualize team statistics.

## Future Improvements

- **Task Comments and Attachments**: Allow team members to add comments and attach files to tasks, enhancing collaboration and detail-sharing.
- **Enhanced User Roles and Permissions**: Add user roles such as Admin, Member, and Viewer, each with specific permissions for creating, editing, or viewing tasks.
- **Notifications and Reminders**: Implement a notification system for upcoming deadlines and reminders for incomplete tasks.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more detailed charts and graphs, such as individual performance analytics, sprint overviews, and burndown charts.
- **Integrations with Other Platforms**: Support integrations with popular platforms like Slack, Trello, and Google Calendar for cross-platform synchronization.
- **AI-Powered Task Recommendations**: Use machine learning to analyze user productivity and suggest task prioritization or workflow improvements.
